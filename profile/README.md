ðŸ‘€ Our lab develops multimodal neuroimaging platforms to explore systems-level neurovascular and metabolic events during neurogenesis, normal development and neurodegeneration. 

ðŸ§  We are interested in the life of brain cells inside living animals, particularly in the context of neuronal activity, oxygen and glucose metabolism.
